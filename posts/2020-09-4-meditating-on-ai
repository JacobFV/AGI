Read and reflected on [*Towards a statistical mechanics of consciousness: maximization of number of connections is associated with conscious awareness*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00821) Although operating on a free energy minimization, the brain acts to maximize its entropy. I realized the entropy or self-information is inversely related to energy. However, this entropy is a function of disconnected neurons. Large ensembles -> few microstates. The entropic force of the brain's joint distribution maintains local energy gradients/entropy minima such as ion gradiants. The brain then bcomes a maximum entropy model of its environment as gaussian processes are of their dataset.

I noted that the Bayesian brain theory makes a sort of inverse model policy following its maximum entropy predictions of environmental state.
