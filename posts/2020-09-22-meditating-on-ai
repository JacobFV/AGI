Superintelligence poses threats of goal drift and erroneous autonomous goal shaping. I might use 'parent' AI's to guide 'child' AI's toward human-friendly behavior while not directly hacking the child AI's reward function.

If I can't build a computer inside TDW, I might make one of the doorways lead to a computer world where the agent's actuators a diectly applied to mouse and keyboard and sensors directly to screen and audio.

Information DNN neuron regularization penalizes the difference between marginal mutual information between neurons and the mutual information of activations/weight sums when conditioned on a particular multinomial class. (I will need to adopt a differential metric) This teaches me to look for the information theoretic foundations behind 'intuitive' yet actually limited concepts as weight divergence.
