*Compiled* more relevant papers from arxiv. Notable ones:
- *Explore then Execute: Adapting without Rewards via Factorized Meta-Reinforcement Learning* encourages viewing exploration as trying to identify the information from a scene that guided an execution policy
- *Compositional Networks Enable Systematic Generalization for Grounded Language Understanding* makes an RNN network out of lexicographically structured graphical probablistic models. I think this support my model to a nodular network

*I feel* intellect performance varies with the richness of developmental environment and the human environment is most rich of all for agents that interact in the human behavior space.

*Learned about* [ThreeD World](http://threedworld.org/)
  - Supports rigid body, multibody, constrained body, soft body, cloth, and fluid simulation
  - acoustic impact generation
  - many builtin environments, models, and procedural generation tools
  - Unity on the back end, so I may be able to write my own custom elements (like computer)
  - Windows required for advanced physics, but I can offload rendering

*Problem*: After installing with pip, I was able to run a tutorial. However, later vscode installed pylint. Then I could not get it to work. I think either that or failing to `terminate` connections are to blame. I will investigate this more tomorrow.

*To think about* robotic interface
  - 2D image sensor
  - what kind of body? humanoid? are the physics real?
