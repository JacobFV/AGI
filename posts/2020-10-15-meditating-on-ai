Talking with my brother, he explained conscious representation as situating a thought between thought "extrema". These "extrema" are the foremost concrete instantiations of the thought they represent perhaps forming a new dimensional basis for later thoughts to rest on.

After reviewing yesterday's thoughts, I realize it would be useful to AGI to not only weight evidence for positive but also negative stimulii. The agent propperly trained under a few negative reinforcement trials should never again return to that aversive state to unlearn the association â€“ even if the stimulii is gone. System 2 may ackowledge that there is no danger, but System 1 which provides most of the motivation force 'knows' otherwise and remains afraid. (System 1 knows from experience; System 2 *knows about*) This, in addition to accelerated training under expected positive or negitive can bias unsupervised APD minimization (habituated) learning.
