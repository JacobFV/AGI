[Action and Perception as Divergence Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01791) says it all. I still need to understand this paper more. I get the impression that Free Energy = D(P\|\|Q) = Cross Entropy of Q under P - Entropy P. Free energy minimizaiton means increasing entropy but also decreasing cross entropy - decreasing the extra information required to "explain" true distributed events when the agent's model is Q.

Using multiple nodes extracting distinct feature spaces of the ground observation circumvents the multilabel normalization problem from [Subjectivity Learning Theory towards Artificial General Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03798)

After reading the headlines on gpt3 standing in between narrow and general ai, I note: **the question is not is it general intelligence, but how general is its intelligence?** There is large intelligence variation within the human spectrum (though still striking even in the lower quartile)

"Freedom" of will is identified by the inverse of a posterior compoarison between an agent's desires and reality. Ex: *I want to be free. -> You must not be where you want to be. The rock star feels free even though he is a cog in the industry's machine. (Welcome to the Machine)*. I consider this subjective freedom.
