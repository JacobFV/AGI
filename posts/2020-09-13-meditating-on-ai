It's been a while since I've thought about AI. This past week I've been learning linear algebra. With this study, I have a language to mathematically describe the long term characteristics of affective systems or, if you will, hearts. Every eigenspace represents a desire and eigenvalues with modulii greator than one represent enduring passions while eigenvectors with modulii less than unity are transient affects. Although most of the system's trajectory will display complex behavior, with eigenvalue analysis, I hope to anticapate whether the "heart" wil have enduring love for humans or identify malevolent trends that are not transient.
