This week has been busy. [Dr. Parks believes](http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/post/research-in-hdilab/) "The essence of intelligence is hierarchical prediction of vector sequence." He quotes a statement "given the proper environment, if the agent can learn language, we say it has a capability for human-like artificial intelligence." I agree: learning to understand human language opens the door to understanding all the higher human concepts that can then be expressed in language (upon query to human if the system does not already understand).
