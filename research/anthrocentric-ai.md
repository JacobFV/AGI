# Anthrocentric AI

Collection of AI research pertaining to anthrocentric intelligence such as visual understanding, open domain conversation, spatial reasoning, etc.
  
- [If I Hear You Correctly: Building and Evaluating Interview Chatbots with Active Listening Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01862)

- [ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN SUPERVISION AND SELF-PLAY IN EMERGENT COMMUNICATION](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01093)
  > first training agents via supervised learning on human data followed by self-play outperforms the converse, suggesting that it is not beneficial to emerge languages from scratch. \[. . .\] population based approaches to S2P [supervised self-play] further improves the performance over single-agent methods.
  
- [EgoMap: Projective mapping and structured egocentric memory for Deep RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02286)
  - builds grid of memory embeddings as agent travels
