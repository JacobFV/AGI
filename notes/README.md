Simplifying affective states as a hidden variable in the latent dynamics of every cortical column, the digital heart is coallescing emotive system unifying various domains of processing and nondifferentiably influencing the physiological state which, in turn, biases activation patterns. I still need to rigorously formulate this concept mathematically and detirmine to what extent affective state should be policy vs. environmentally controlled.

*Compiled* more relevant papers from arxiv. Notable ones:
- *Explore then Execute: Adapting without Rewards via Factorized Meta-Reinforcement Learning* encourages viewing exploration as trying to identify the information from a scene that guided an execution policy
- *Compositional Networks Enable Systematic Generalization for Grounded Language Understanding* makes an RNN network out of lexicographically structured graphical probablistic models. I think this support my model to a nodular network

*I feel* intellect performance varies with the richness of developmental environment and the human environment is most rich of all for agents that interact in the human behavior space.

*Learned about* [ThreeD World](http://threedworld.org/)
  - Supports rigid body, multibody, constrained body, soft body, cloth, and fluid simulation
  - acoustic impact generation
  - many builtin environments, models, and procedural generation tools
  - Unity on the back end, so I may be able to write my own custom elements (like computer)
  - Windows required for advanced physics, but I can offload rendering

*Problem*: After installing with pip, I was able to run a tutorial. However, later vscode installed pylint. Then I could not get it to work. I think either that or failing to `terminate` connections are to blame. I will investigate this more tomorrow.

*To think about* robotic interface
  - 2D image sensor
  - what kind of body? humanoid? are the physics real?
